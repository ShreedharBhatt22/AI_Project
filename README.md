Recruiters and HR teams in companies have a tough time scanning thousands of qualified resumes. Either they need many people to do this or they miss out on qualified candidates. This is a waste of time, money and productivity for the company.
To solve this, our resume parser application can take in millions of resumes, parse the needed fields and categorise them. This resume parser uses the popular python library - Tesseract for OCR and text classifications. We use cosine similarity to determine the similarity of the uploaded job description and the resumes.
